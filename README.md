This is a record of my journey through the Google Foobar Recruitment competition. 
It pops up with repeated activity of searching for coding-related terminology (for me it happened when I was searching up list mutability in python).
It gives you a log-in and a series of problems in levels, which get progressively harder to solve, needing complex data structures and algorithms.
This is obviously way above my current level, as this is a legitimate way google recruits developers, but I was happy to be fortunate enough to get this opportunity.
